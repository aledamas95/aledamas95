- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aledamas95
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in science, philosophy, metaphysics, poetry, writing, researching, mural art, culinary arts, fitness, and boxing or any fighting art.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data analysis from Python, SGL, IBM Cognos, Jupyter notebooks, and plenty more. I also look forward to furthering my education in neuroscience and physics and delving deep into discoveries that can heal humanity.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: SHE
- âš¡ Fun fact: The pineal gland is known as the "seat of the soul" because it was believed to have been the portal between the physical and the spiritual realm.
